The primary objective of this repository is to showcase my creative skills in the field of web development using VanillaJS/TypeScript and React. While I am also learning other libraries like Astro and Vue, currently, only animations implemented in VanillaJS and React are available.
For now if you have any knowledge about this libraries, feel to collaborate or make a PR. Will be down to merge
